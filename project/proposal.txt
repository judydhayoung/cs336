I want to make a platform for textbook exchange at Calvin.
We currently use facebook to upload photos of books. But it is a pain to look through the pictures,
and the facebook group's search function cannot read the name of book if it's not in the description.
A webapp for textbook exchange would make things easier.
It would include fields for textbook name, course, professor (optional), and price (optional).
Some people prefer to negotiate the price so they don't upload it which is fine.
It would also have information about the seller's name and contact information.
  - everyone would have to create an account to use this, either to sell or buy
  - additional feature would be to connect the user's profile to Facebook and automatically import the name and contact info.

No particular people to avoid working with, but would like to work with people I've never worked with.
A mixed group of personalities and cs skills where I can contribute and learn from others.
