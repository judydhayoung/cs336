exercise 1
1. Identify the request methods that you can and can’t test using the two tools listed above.
If a method cannot be testing using a particular tool, explain why this is the case.

The browser can only successfully send get requests. It needs a mechanism like forms to request information using the methods
put, post, delete or head. The command line can process all requests. i.e.:
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/request -d '{"arg": "value"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'

2. What is the most appropriate HTTP response code for pages that aren’t defined by an Express route?
404 not found

exercise 2
1. What HTTP methods do forms support? get or post.
2. How is the form data being passed back to the server and what syntactic form does it take? Is the data modified in any way?
The data is sent back to a server in json format. The data is not really modified.
